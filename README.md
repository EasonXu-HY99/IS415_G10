# Geospatial Analytics Project

## Project Title: 
**[Insert Your Project Title]**

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a web-based geospatial analytics tool to explore, analyze, and visualize spatial data using open-source web mapping APIs, data visualization APIs, and geospatial analysis libraries. We focus on spatial issues related to **[insert country]**, applying geospatial techniques to address **[insert topic/problem]** for deeper insights and decision-making.

### Project Motivation
The project explores **[insert key issues or problems, e.g., "the impact of drug abuse across regions in Thailand and its correlation with socio-economic factors"]**. We aim to provide actionable insights by leveraging geospatial data analysis techniques and visualization tools.

## Objectives
- To apply geospatial analytics techniques such as **[insert chosen theme, e.g., Spatial Point Patterns Analysis, Geographically Weighted Regression Models, etc.]**.
- To develop an interactive web application for exploring geospatial data.
- To visualize and interpret the spatial relationships present in real-world data.
- To provide a user-friendly tool for analyzing and interacting with geospatial data.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: A web-based interactive map allowing users to visualize **[insert feature, e.g., crime hotspots, disaster-affected regions, etc.]**.
- **Data Exploration**: Users can filter, search, and explore datasets based on various parameters (e.g., time, location, severity).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes spatial analysis techniques such as **[insert analysis methods, e.g., spatial clustering, regression models, spatial autocorrelation]**.
- **Visualizations**: Detailed data visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots to support analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Web Mapping API(s)**: [Insert API, e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox, Google Maps API]
- **Data Visualization API(s)**: [Insert API, e.g., D3.js, Plotly, Chart.js]
- **Geospatial Libraries**: [Insert libraries, e.g., `sf`, `tidyverse`, `spdep`]
- **Backend**: R, Shiny (for interactive web applications)
- **Frontend**: Quarto (for website creation), HTML, CSS
- **Hosting**: Netlify (for publishing the project website)
- **Version Control**: GitHub (for project collaboration and versioning)

## Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: [Insert dataset name, e.g., Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) for Myanmar]
- **Additional Datasets**: [Insert other datasets, e.g., National Statistical Office of Thailand, Philippine Statistics Authority, etc.]
