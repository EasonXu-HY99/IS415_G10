    "text": "Welcome to our geospatial analytics project website. This project focuses on Vietnam and explores Spatial Point Patterns Analysis and Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis using geospatial data and web-based tools to investigate the country’s economic development from 2019 to 2023.\n\n\nThis project is motivated by a recent news report on Cambodia’s construction of a China-funded canal and the potential economic and environmental impacts on neighboring Vietnam. Initially, we intended to study Cambodia’s economic development surrounding the canal project. However, due to the short timeline and limited data, we decided to shift our focus to Vietnam. Specifically, we are investigating how Vietnam’s economy developed in the past five years (2019-2023) and how infrastructure projects like Cambodia’s canal could influence the country’s economy.\n\n\n\n\nTo apply geospatial analysis techniques to explore Spatial Point Patterns in Vietnam’s economic development across provinces.\nTo build a user-friendly web application for data exploration and visualization of economic trends.\nTo provide valuable insights for policymakers, economists, and development agencies on regional economic patterns and disparities.\n\n\n\n\nWe are using a combination of open-source web mapping APIs, data visualization tools, and geospatial analysis libraries to achieve our objectives. Here is an overview of the approach we are taking:\n\n\n\nPrimary Dataset: Vietnam economic indicators (GDP, trade, FDI) from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nAdditional Datasets: Environmental data from the Mekong River Commission and geopolitical data from ACLED related to cross-border tensions and economic impacts from Cambodia’s canal project.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Mapping API: Leaflet.js for interactive geospatial mapping.\nData Visualization: Plotly.js for dynamic data charts and graphs.\nGeospatial Analysis Libraries: sf and spdep for spatial data wrangling and analysis in R.\nWeb Framework: Quarto for generating the project website and Shiny for the interactive web application.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the project to generate the following outcomes:\n\nInteractive Maps: Users will be able to explore the spatial distribution of economic growth across Vietnam.\nStatistical Insights: The application will provide spatial statistical outputs such as clustering, regression models, and point pattern analysis of economic activity.\nData Filtering: Users can filter the data by year, region, and economic indicators, allowing for dynamic exploration of Vietnam’s economic development over the past five years.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we anticipate success, the project presents some challenges, such as: - Data Quality: Variations in the resolution of economic and environmental data may affect analysis accuracy. - Performance Optimization: Handling large datasets in a web application may require performance tuning to ensure smooth user experience.\nFuture iterations may include incorporating real-time data or expanding the analysis to include more complex economic modeling."

While the project has sparked interest, the limited availability of data and the short period since its inception made it difficult to analyse the economic impacts on Cambodia.\nFurther investigation into the news revealed concerns about the project’s environmental impact on neighbouring Vietnam, particularly regarding the Mekong Delta, a critical economic region for Vietnam. This prompted our group to shift focus to Vietnam’s economic development over the last five years (2019-2023), aiming to explore how this economic growth has evolved and how future infrastructure projects like the canal might influence the country’s economy.\nVietnam has made significant strides in economic development, transitioning from one of the poorest countries to a middle-income nation. We focus on Vietnam’s development from 2019 to 2023, a crucial period marked by resilience in the face of global challenges such as COVID-19. Understanding how Vietnam navigated these challenges and continued its growth can offer insights for future economic planning, especially as the country aims to achieve high-income status by 2045.\nWe plan to investigate the overall economic development trends in Vietnam, using the most recent five years as a baseline, and provide insights into how projects like Cambodia’s Funan Canal project may further impact Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Vulnerability to External Projects: Vietnam’s economy, particularly its trade and agriculture sectors, may face challenges from external infrastructure projects like Cambodia’s canal. The canal could divert trade routes, impacting Vietnam’s ports and potentially reducing their economic importance.\nEnvironmental and Agricultural Risks: The Mekong Delta, a key agricultural region, may face environmental changes due to the canal’s impact on water resources, which could, in turn, affect Vietnam’s agricultural output and overall economic stability.\nEconomic Disparities Across Regions: Vietnam has experienced rapid economic growth, but this development has not been evenly distributed. Our analysis aims to explore how different regions have fared during the 2019-2023 period and identify patterns of growth and disparity.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies on Vietnam’s economic development have emphasised its rapid industrialization, growing export economy, and integration into global markets through free trade agreements. Research has also highlighted Vietnam’s dependence on the Mekong Delta for agriculture, which plays a significant role in the country’s economy and could be impacted by water-related projects like Cambodia’s canal.\nIn terms of geospatial analysis, prior work has explored the spatial distribution of economic activities across Vietnam, highlighting disparities between urban and rural regions. Additionally, studies on transboundary water resource management between Vietnam and Cambodia underscore the geopolitical and environmental concerns associated with infrastructure projects like the canal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will gather comprehensive datasets to track Vietnam’s economic performance from 2019 to 2023. These datasets will include:\n\nEconomic Data: GDP growth, trade, foreign direct investment, and labour market indicators sourced from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and Vietnam’s General Statistics Office (GSO).\nEnvironmental Data: Mekong River water flow data and environmental indicators sourced from the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and Global Forest Watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Point Patterns Analysis: This will help us explore how economic activities, such as GDP growth, are distributed across Vietnam’s regions. We will investigate whether there are clusters or specific regions showing significant economic development and whether these regions are positioned to be impacted by external projects like the Cambodian canal.\nExploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA): ESDA will allow us to visualise and assess spatial relationships between economic variables, such as trade activity and labour market conditions, across Vietnam’s provinces. This approach will help us identify geographic disparities in economic development.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistency across datasets, we will harmonise them using spatial interpolation and transformation techniques. This will involve aligning various data sources to common geographical units, such as Vietnam’s administrative divisions (provinces and districts).\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Map: We have begun developing an interactive map that displays economic indicators, such as GDP growth, across Vietnam’s provinces for 2019-2023.\nSpatial Analysis: We have also sketched out visualisations showing the distribution of economic activity and identifying potential regions that might be most affected by the Cambodian canal project in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive Economic Baseline: We will provide an in-depth analysis of Vietnam’s economic development over the past five years, identifying key regions of growth and disparity.\nImpact Prediction: Using spatial analysis, we aim to predict how projects like Cambodia’s canal could influence Vietnam’s economy, particularly in the Mekong Delta region.\nGeospatial Visualisations: We will develop interactive maps and visualisations that clearly illustrate economic trends across Vietnam, highlighting regions that may be vulnerable to external changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Gaps: While we expect to collect comprehensive data, there may be gaps or missing neighbour provinces in high-resolution environmental and conflict data for specific regions in Vietnam.\nCross-border Impacts: Analysing the indirect impact of external projects like Cambodia’s canal on Vietnam’s economy may be difficult due to the limited availability of cross-border economic interaction data.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Link: EasonXu-HY99/IS415_G10: IS415 G10 group project (github.com)\n\n\n\n\nAP News.
