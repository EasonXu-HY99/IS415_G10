### **Mapping Vietnam’s Economic Pulse: A Geospatial Exploration of Growth Hotspots (2012-2023)**

By Group G10:

-   Haiyang, Singapore Management University

-   Ming Yan, Singapore Management University

-   Javier, Singapore Management University

This project is part of Singapore Management University’s IS415 Geospatial Analytics & Applications 2023, under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong.

The aim of our project is to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore Vietnam’s economic development across provinces from 2012 to 2023. By using techniques such as **Analytical Regionalisation** and **Geographically Weighted Regression**, we provide valuable insights into the country’s economic growth patterns, regional disparities, and economic hotspots — all without the need for users to write a single line of code.
