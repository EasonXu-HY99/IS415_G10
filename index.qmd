# Geospatial Analytics Project

Welcome to our geospatial analytics project website. This project focuses on **Vietnam** and explores **Spatial Point Patterns Analysis** and **Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis** using geospatial data and web-based tools to investigate the country's economic development from 2019 to 2023.

## Motivation

This project is motivated by a recent news report on Cambodia's construction of a China-funded canal and the potential economic and environmental impacts on neighboring Vietnam. Initially, we intended to study Cambodia's economic development surrounding the canal project. However, due to the short timeline and limited data, we decided to shift our focus to Vietnam. Specifically, we are investigating how Vietnam's economy developed in the past five years (2019-2023) and how infrastructure projects like Cambodia's canal could influence the country's economy.

## Objectives

- To apply geospatial analysis techniques to explore **Spatial Point Patterns** in Vietnam's economic development across provinces.
- To build a user-friendly web application for data exploration and visualization of economic trends.
- To provide valuable insights for policymakers, economists, and development agencies on regional economic patterns and disparities.

## Approach

We are using a combination of open-source web mapping APIs, data visualization tools, and geospatial analysis libraries to achieve our objectives. Here is an overview of the approach we are taking:

### Data Sources

- **Primary Dataset**: Vietnam economic indicators (GDP, trade, FDI) from the **World Bank** and **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**.
- **Additional Datasets**: Environmental data from the **Mekong River Commission** and geopolitical data from **ACLED** related to cross-border tensions and economic impacts from Cambodia's canal project.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Web Mapping API**: Leaflet.js for interactive geospatial mapping.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly.js for dynamic data charts and graphs.
- **Geospatial Analysis Libraries**: `sf` and `spdep` for spatial data wrangling and analysis in R.
- **Web Framework**: Quarto for generating the project website and Shiny for the interactive web application.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect the project to generate the following outcomes:

- **Interactive Maps**: Users will be able to explore the spatial distribution of economic growth across Vietnam.
- **Statistical Insights**: The application will provide spatial statistical outputs such as clustering, regression models, and point pattern analysis of economic activity.
- **Data Filtering**: Users can filter the data by year, region, and economic indicators, allowing for dynamic exploration of Vietnam's economic development over the past five years.

## Challenges and Future Work

While we anticipate success, the project presents some challenges, such as:
- **Data Quality**: Variations in the resolution of economic and environmental data may affect analysis accuracy.
- **Performance Optimization**: Handling large datasets in a web application may require performance tuning to ensure smooth user experience.

Future iterations may include incorporating real-time data or expanding the analysis to include more complex economic modeling.
