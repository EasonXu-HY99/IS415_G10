### **Mapping Vietnam’s Farm Economic Pulse: A Geospatial Exploration of Growth Hotspots (2012-2023)**

By Group G10:

-   Xu Haiyang, Singapore Management University

-   Han Ming Yan, Singapore Management University

-   Javier Lian, Singapore Management University

This project is part of Singapore Management University’s IS415 Geospatial Analytics & Applications 2024, under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong.

The aim of our project is to create an interactive web application that allows users to explore Vietnam’s farm economic development across provinces from 2012 to 2023. By using techniques such as **Analytical Regionalisation** and **Geographical Segmentation**, we provide valuable insights into the country’s farm economic growth patterns, regional disparities, and economic hotspots — all without the need for users to write a single line
