# Geospatial Analytics Project

Welcome to our geospatial analytics project website. This project focuses on \[Insert country\] and explores \[Insert chosen analytical theme\] using geospatial data and web-based tools.

## Motivation

This project is motivated by \[Insert a brief description of the problem, e.g., "the need to better understand the spatial distribution of drug offenses across Thailand and how law enforcement resources are allocated"\].

## Objectives

-   To apply geospatial analysis techniques to \[Insert objective, e.g., explore spatial point patterns in drug offenses\].
-   To build a user-friendly web application for data exploration and visualization.
-   To provide valuable insights for \[Insert stakeholders, e.g., law enforcement agencies, public policy makers\].

## Approach

We use a combination of open-source web mapping APIs, data visualization tools, and geospatial analysis libraries to achieve our objectives. Here is an overview of the approach we are taking:

### Data Sources

-   **\[Primary Dataset\]**: \[Provide a brief description of your main dataset, e.g., Thailand Drug Offenses dataset from Kaggle\].
-   **Additional Datasets**: \[Mention other relevant datasets, e.g., Thailandâ€™s subnational boundaries from HDX\].

### Tools and Technologies

-   **Web Mapping API**: \[Insert API, e.g., Leaflet.js, Mapbox\]
-   **Data Visualization**: \[Insert API, e.g., Plotly.js, D3.js\]
-   **Geospatial Analysis Libraries**: \[Insert libraries, e.g., `sf`, `spdep`\]
-   **Web Framework**: Quarto, Shiny

## Early Prototypes

We have started with early prototypes of the web application. Below are screenshots of the initial interface and maps.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect the project to generate the following outcomes:

-   **Interactive Maps**: Users will be able to explore the spatial distribution of \[insert theme\].
-   **Statistical Insights**: The application will provide spatial statistical outputs such as \[insert methods, e.g., hot spot analysis, clustering, regression models\].
-   **Data Filtering**: Users can filter data by date, region, and other key parameters.

## Challenges and Future Work

While we anticipate success, the project presents some challenges, such as data quality and performance optimization for large datasets. Future iterations may include real-time data integration and expanded analysis features.
